Writeup of Project 3

1.	Challenge:
Managing the state effectively, especially for features like user authentication (login/logout) and dynamic content updates, posed some complexity. Ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the current state without unnecessary re-renders was crucial. 
I had some difficulties in managing states when it comes to rendering and react components, such as handleSavePostUpdate() in homepage and userpage, handleBioUpdate () in  UserProfileCard component, it’s very challenging to pass the functions/states/params from parent to child components. 

2.	Features to be added:
If I have more time, I’d like to build a more detailed user profile, with an Avatar/profile pic, and make it accessible for all users to post in more formats, like pic, videos. Also, add friend groups, msg notification, trend…

3.	Assumptions:
Assume most users would like to see their latest changes immediately after they post/update/delete. Also assume users would like to have cancel buttons

4.	Time take:
It took me about 3 days.
